1. Background
Since we all know that lockdown has started since march there are many people who are dying due to lack of food. Government is doing lot many efforts to solve this issue but still this is the biggest issue during this pandemic and in this pandemic the condition of poor people have became worse than earlier as we are noticing these things in televisions , social media , etc. So we are giving the users and NGO’s a platform to connect with each other and can serve for those who don’t have food to eat.
Since we all know whenever there’s a function or an event in a hotel there is large quantity of food which gets wasted  so rather than throwing that food in the garbage bins we can use that food by feeding poors and help them to survive the pandemic and even after that.
So we are indulging our innovation into reality by developing a website which gives a platform to all the Ngo’s serving for the former purpose.
In this website we can not only feed the poors rather we can donate our old clothes to them as well.
 
2. Goals
Hunger, poverty and food prices are inextricably linked. Not every person living in poverty is hungry, but almost all hungry people are living in poverty. Millions live with hunger and malnourishment because they simply cannot afford to buy enough food, cannot afford nutritious foods or cannot afford the farming supplies they need to grow enough good food of their own. Hunger can be viewed as a dimension of extreme poverty. It is often called the most severe and critical manifestation of poverty. There are people in the world so hungry, that God cannot appear to them except in the form of bread as hunger is an ungrateful wretch. So now, we have to safe the food from those people who don't respect food and waste food so that in this world no one should have to go to bed hungry. Our focus Save the food from greedier and feed the needier and for a better country’s progression we need to focus on health and health comes from food.
This website has some basic goals such as:
Firstly, we want to diminish the death rates of our country due to lack of food or malnourishment by doing this our country progress rate will increase directly. Secondly to provide a united platform for all Ngo’s working across the country for the same.  Hence spreading it widely among every citizen for this initiative.
Thirdly we want to reduce extreme hunger and poverty.
Lastly, we want to set an example for the ongoing and upcoming generation to numerate these initiatives using technology for the development of everyone and in every aspect.

3. Scope
Technically if we see then hunger is one the huge issue to debate on.
Scope of our website:
We are brining are imagination in reality basically we all have a dream that people in pandemic or any other situation doesn't die because of lack of food.
This is a team that runs behind the needier, so needier doesn't have to run behind anyone.
This website will motivate everyone across the world that if we can't feed hundred we can feed one as even the life of one matter, who are being violated due to poverty thus leading to hunger.
We want to overpower this crisis in our country and nevertheless technology is the best way to accomplish it.
 
4. Key Stakeholders
Team members are:-
Anshu Priya– SRM IST 
Hemant Tyagi– SRM IST 
Nandini Raj– SRM IST 
Ria Bhardwaj – SRM IST 
Saurabh Trivedi – SRM IST 
Tanu Bhardwaj – SRM IST 

5. Project Milestones
Start date of the project is 15th July.
End date of the project is 27th July.
The milestone of the project is to reach the maximum population where one feeding the other is the motivation. And if u can’t feed hundred feed one is the goal.
Even if one feed one, then India will soon become a country where problem of hunger or malnourishment will diminish.
The project’s destiny is to let maximum people participate .So we’ll get quantity along with quality.

6. Project Budget
The best part of this project is that it doesn’t require a huge amount. And by amount we doesn’t mean cash we mean awareness of not wasting food rather we can give that to Ngo's they can serve poor.
In the website we have given a list of Ngo’s state wise so that it will be easy for users to serve poor. Due to this website helping poor is just one click away.
So concluding, it’s non funded project requiring minimal or no amount of money, which directly aims in saving the food from greedier and funding to needier. 

7. Constraints:
Technically if we see then with any project, there are limitations and risks that need to be taken into account and addressed to ensure the project’s ultimate success. The three primary constrains that project managers should be familiar with time, scope and cost.
Time constraint: In time constraint there are 3 three which plays a major role that is Planning, Scheduling, Monitoring and Control.
1.	Planning: This includes defining the main goal(s) of the project team, how the team intends to achieve the goal, and the equipment and/or steps that will be taken to do so.
2.	Scheduling: The project management team must plot out the realistic timeframe for completion of each phase of the project.
3.	Monitoring: This step occurs once the project is underway and requires the project team to analyze how the past stages of the project performed, noting trends and impacts on future plans, and communicating these findings to all relevant stakeholders.
4.	Control: In the control step, the team must, upon communicating the results of each phase of the project, move forward accordingly. That means if things are running smoothly, the team must analyze the factors contributing to that positive outcome so that it can be continued and replicated. If there has been a derailment, the team must know how and why the derailment occurred and take steps to correct it for future actions.

Scope constraints: 
•	Provide clear documentation of the full project scope at the beginning of the project, including all requirements.
•	Set up a process for managing any changes, so if someone proposes a change, there is a controlled system in place for how that change will be reviewed, approved or rejected, and implemented if applicable.
•	Communicate the scope clearly and frequently with stakeholders.
Cost constraint:-
•	Historical data: Looking at what similar projects cost in the recent past
•	Resources: Estimating the rate of cost for goods and labor.
•	Parametric: Comparing historical data with updated, relevant variables
•	Vendor bid: Averaging the total charge of several solid vendor bids

8. Assumptions:
The assumptions on which we are moving further towards the completion are
Firstly, it will reach out to max people across the country
Secondly, it will give a proper platform to all the enhancing Ngo's hence increasing their efficiency 
Thirdly, with less or no amount everyone will be able to contribute in this
Lastly, it will provide a sense of unity sharing and brotherhood among the people

9. Risks:
Risks are the major factor of any project. It includes:-
Project purpose and need is not well-defined. 
Project design and deliverable definition is incomplete.
Project schedule is not clearly defined or understood 
No control over staff priorities Consultant or contractor delays Estimating and/or scheduling errors Unplanned work that must be accommodated Lack of communication, causing lack of clarity and confusion. 
Pressure to arbitrarily reduce task durations and or run tasks in parallel which would increase risk of errors. 
Scope creep Unresolved project conflicts not escalated in a timely manner Business Case becomes obsolete or is undermined by external or internal changes. 
Delay in earlier project phases jeopardizes ability to meet fixed date. 
For example delivery of just in time materials, for conference or launch date.
Added workload or time requirements because of new direction, policy, or statute inadequate customer testing leads to large post go live snag list
Legal action delays or pauses project. 
Customer refuses to approve deliverables/milestones or delays approval, putting pressure on project manager to 'work at risk'
Stakeholder action delays project.
